      <h3> Allyson Felix </h3>
      
      <p>
        Oooouuu!! Allyson "Chicken Legs" Felix.
      If I had an idol, she would be the one.
      Her poise on the track is definitely admired.
      The domination that she holds is unlike any other.
      Such a humble beast she is.
      I wouldn't doubt that she would steal your food, eat it in front of you and clean the dish when she returns it to you.
      She's nice like that. Better known for her mastery of the 
      <!--this link transports you to a description of this event -->
      <a href= "page3.html#200">200M</a> event.
      She has recently been making great strides toward the mastery of the <a href= "page3.html#400">400M</a>.
      Pun intended.

      <h3> Natasha Hastings </h3>
      
      <p>
        The 400M diva. From the covers of track magazines in high school, to top of the podium.
        As signaled by her nickname, Ms. Hastings' primary event is the <a href= "page3.html#400"> 400M </a> a.k.a. the quarter mile.
        She's also a gold medalist in the <a href= "page3.html#4x4">4x4 relay</a>.

      <h3> Justin Gatlin </h3>
      
      <p>
        Mr. Comeback himself.
      After being suspended for 5 years after testing positive for illegal drug use, he came back with a vengeance.
      The typical athlete reaches his/her peak around the age of 30.
      This guy here returned to - in my very biased opinion - the most difficult sport to prepare for at the age of 36;
      and when he arrived, he came with a chip on his shoulder and the hunger of a champion.
      He earned his win over Bolt in Bolt's last <a href= "page3.html#100"> 100M </a> ever.

      <h3> Usain Bolt </h3>
      
      <p>
      The fastest man ever.
      Placing himself at the top of all timesheets as he broke records for all sprinting events that he's run.
      Yet he resides at the bottom of this list because - #TeamUSA.

      <h3> Christian Coleman </h3>
      
      <p>
       Next up to be the fastest man in the world, this guy has been killing it on the track.
       In his professional debut, he placed 3rd in the <a href= "page3.html#100"> 100M </a> dash, behind the fastest man ever solidifying his spot in the sport.
       How about that for a homecoming?

      <h3> Sydney McLoughlin </h3>
      
      <p>
       Also known as Sid the Kid, this young superstar is following in the footsteps of Allyson Felix.
       She was an olympian before she left high school. The event that she qualified for was the <a href="page3.html#400h">400M hurdles</a>
       Her debut wasn't executed as well as it could have been but she definitely has time to grow;
       and she has made a great impact.
