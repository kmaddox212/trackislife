      <p>Primarily an event for indoor tracks. This is the shortest race from the collegiate and pro levels.

      Men's: 6.39 set in 1998 by Maurice Greene (USA)

      Women's: 6.92 set in 1993 by Irina Privalova (RUS)
      </p>
      
      <li id= "100"> 100M </li>
      <p> The shortest of outdoor sprints. Also one of the most anticipated as this is where we determine the fastest
      men and women in the world. A position that has been dominated by Jamaica in the past unfortunately; but USA 
      isn't too far behind.

      <li id= "200"> 200M </li>
      <p>
        This is one race that is near and dear to me as it is one that I ran primarily.
        Just half the distance of the track, this event is physically breath taking as you are constantly upshifting gears.
